# `Latitude Analysis Dashboard`
[Tableau Visualization](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/j.white5586/viz/LatitudeAnalysisDashboard/LatitudeComparisonCharts?publish=yes)


## Project Description

The goal of this project is to build a website based upon a previous project, [Open Weather Map](https://github.com/jimmywhite1987/Open-Weather-Map). The website will contain the following pages, along with the data collected, analyzed, and visualized from the previous project.

* A landing page containing:
  * An explanation of the project.
  * Links to each visualizations page. There should be a sidebar containing preview images of each plot, and clicking an image should take the user to that visualization.
* Four visualization pages, each with:
  * A descriptive title and heading tag.
  * The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
  * A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.
* A "Comparisons" page that:
  * Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them.
  * Uses a Bootstrap grid for the visualizations.
    * The grid must be two visualizations across on screens medium and larger, and 1 across on extra-small and small screens.
* A "Data" page that:
  * Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.
    * The table must be a bootstrap table component.
    * The data must come from exporting the `.csv` file as HTML, or converting it to HTML.

* The website must, at the top of every page, have a navigation menu that:
  * Has the name of the site on the left of the nav which allows users to return to the landing page from any page.
  * Contains a dropdown menu on the right of the navbar named "Plots" that provides a link to each individual visualization page.
  * Provides two more text links on the right: "Comparisons," which links to the comparisons page, and "Data," which links to the data page.
  * Is responsive (using media queries).
